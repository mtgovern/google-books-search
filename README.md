# google-books-search

### Overview

In this activity, I created a new React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment required me to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. I also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.


### Instructions

* This application includes the following 2 pages:

  * [Search] - User can search for books via the Google Books API and render them here. User has the option to "View" a book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Save" a book, saving it to the Mongo database.

  * [Saved] - Renders all books saved to the Mongo database. User has an option to "View" the book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Delete" a book, removing it from the Mongo database.
